# Pokegear GO
A standalone Pokemon GO scanner for iOS

Pokegear aims to be the all-in-one solution for Pokemon GO players. With plans to include scanning filters, background alerts, stat calculators as well as pokemon reference Pokegear GO will change the game.

## Notice
I am putting the Skiplagged version of this app on hold as the internet works on a new API for Pokemon GO. Furthermore with the current method of the Skiplagged API the app will still be denied from the appstore as it pulls profile data from Niantic directly. I only used Skiplagged as a means to push computations offdevice as well as circumvent iOS restrictions.
In the meantime I will be working on other reference features of the app, as well as possibly communicating directly with Niantic servers and releasing the app elsewhere, such as iPwnstore or Builds.io
